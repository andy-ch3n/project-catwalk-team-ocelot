# Updating the Repository

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/fec-project-catwalk-team-ocelot/project-catwalk-team-ocelot.git`

After you've done that, updating your repo is as simple as running the following:

- `git checkout master       // Your fork's master branch`
- `git pull upstream master  // Your class's master branch`

This will check out your branch and tell git to grab any changes made to the main repository and merge them into your branch.
